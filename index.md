## About Myself:

I am an innovative game programmer with over 3 years of experience in gaming at college. I have always been passionate in gaming especially in how they are made. I have created and developed prototype games that were voted the top games in my collage class, one of them being clicker prototype game, developed for both pc and mobile called - Recycling tycoon and another one being an adventure platformer Spooky Scary Steve and the Skeletal Sketastrophe.
I Worked with an amazing team in which we developed a prototype game in under a week based from the Marvels Avengers IP in which we called : Avengers Infinity War The Game! Seeking lead game programmer position to utilise knowledge and skills to advance portfolio and potential for increased responsibility.

I have an average understanding of coding on C# but I am excited to increase my knowledge. I have only worked in a college environment so far, however I'm looking forward to stepping into the gaming industry.
One of my biggest desires is to work as part of a team, as I am a highly sociable worker. I am capable of working with different types of people or alone. One of my strengths is that I am able to quickly think of new innovative ideas and adapt them depending on the target audience. I'm exceptionally good at taking constructive criticism in order to develop and improve my ideas and build on them, to generally improve the overall project or task provided by a Client or project manager.

I have over 3 years of experience in Construct 3, Unity, C#, Python (Programming language), Visual studios, GitHub and Sourcetree

Currently I am working on the 2nd year of Game Design level 3 after achieving a distinction grade in the first year and I am currently on track for a distinction this year which is equivalent to 3 A-Levels.

I am fluent in English language.
