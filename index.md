## About Myself:

I am an innovative game programmer with over 3 years of experience in gaming field. I have helped launch prototype games that were both voted the top games in my collage class, clicker game known as - Recycling tycoon and the adventure platformer Spooky Scary Steve and the Skeletal Sketastrophe. Worked with an amazing team in which we developed a prototype game in under a week based from the Marvels Avengers IP in which we called : Avengers Infinity war the game! Seeking lead game programmer position to utilise knowledge and skills to advance portfolio and potential for increased responsibility.

One of my biggest desires is to work as part of a team, as I am a highly sociable worker. I am capable of working with different types of people. One of my strengths is that I am able to quickly think of new innovative ideas and adapt them depending on the target audience. I'm exceptionally good at taking constructive criticism in order to develop and improve my ideas and build on from them, to generally improve the overall project or task provided by a Client or project manager.

I have experience in Construct 3, Unity, C#, Python (Programming language), Visual studios, GitHub and Sourcetree

Currently I am working on the 2nd year of Game Design level 3 after achieving a Distinction grade in the first year and is currently on track for a distinction this year which is equivalent to 3 A-Levels.
